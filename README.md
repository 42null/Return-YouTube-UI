If you try it out, please let me know if the changes feels natural on your device/aspect ratio.

**In addition, any screenshots or saved pages from before the UI change would be appreciated if you have them. Finding diffrences that could be applied without creating the old view from scratch would simplifly the process.**

Feel free to message me with any questions or suggestions! :)
